RulerGrid
=========

Easily create ruler-based grids in Sketch

## Install this plugin

Download and then double click `RulerGrid.sketchplugin` to install the plugin.

## Usage

- From the Plugins menu at the top, select `RulerGrid` and enter your grid details.
- The plugin is pretty basic, it asks for a few inputs: grid width, number of columns, and gutter width. Once you supply those values, the rulers are automatically added, and you can start working with your grid!


(Make sure that Rulers are visible on your artboard with ﻿CTRL + R﻿).
